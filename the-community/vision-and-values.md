# Vision and Values

## Our Vision

Our collective vision is to **be a source of light during the transitioning times on the planet**. We aim to build a decentralized application that enables community members access to a healing network of practitioners locally or remotely.

Future developments will include the ability to crowd-source projects and aid humanity in conscious ascension and planetary healing.

### How does this work?

The Healers Network will be available to all users to access healers, coaches, tarot readers, psychics and intuitive channels worldwide. To be added to the Healers Network to provide services, users must actively hold at least 1 Sacred Scarab NFT.&#x20;

Practitioners and coaches of many different healing modalities may offer services through their personal profile page. Healers will determine whether they provide services locally or remotely.&#x20;

For remote healers, additional features will be built into the app that allow for live video chat as well as internal messaging. We will also be including an internal scheduling system to allow for client management and bookings directly.

Rates for services and offerings will be set by each practitioner using the Sacred Scarabs Token OR they may choose to accept donations for services. If accepting donations, the user who received the service will be prompted to choose a donation amount (in the form of Sacred Scarabs Token) after service completion.

Coaches and healers may also upload content in the form of training packages and be payed-per-view using the future Sacred Scarabs Token.

The Sacred Scarabs Marketplace will allow for Sacred Scarab holders to list their personal creations for sale using the Sacred Scarab Token as payment as well as list NFTs from external collections.

We are presently developing our own internal project funding page where users will share their story and use held NFTs to raise capital and fund real life lightworker projects.&#x20;

As funded projects progress, users will have the option to share how the funding had been used and show progression on their dreams. When others see that their resources are being put to good use, raising funding in later stages will become easier and easier.

The ultimate vision is to pay it forward. After projects have reached a position of becoming profitable in the real world. Project managers can then choose to buyback the original NFTs that were sold to fund their projects using profits.
